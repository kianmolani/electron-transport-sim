# electron-transport-sim

In this program, Monte Carlo simulations and finite difference techniques are used to model the transport of electrons through N-type Si semiconductor crystals and dielectric bottleneck regions. The following 'high-level' device parameters were extracted from the simulation: potential and electric field maps, temperature maps, plots of current as a function of time, and device resistance.
